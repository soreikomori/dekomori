## 1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) 
and Dekomori (“we," “us," or “our”), concerning your access to and use of Dekomori (the “Bot”). 
You agree that by accessing the Bot, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. 
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE BOT AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Bot from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. 
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. 
We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. 
Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use the Bot so that you understand which Terms apply. 
You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of 
the Bot after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.

The information provided on the Bot is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such 
distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or 
country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Bot from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible 
for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.


## 2. USER REPRESENTATIONS

By using the Bot, you represent and warrant that: 
(1) you have the legal capacity and you agree to comply with these Terms of Use; 
(2) you are not a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside; 
(3) you will not access the Bot through automated or non-human means, whether through a bot, script, or otherwise; 
(4) you will not use the Bot for any illegal or unauthorized purpose; and 
(5) your use of the Bot will not violate any applicable law or regulation.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and 
refuse any and all current or future use of the Bot (or any portion thereof).


## 3. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

You may not access or use the Bot for any purpose other than that for which we make the Bot available. 
The Bot may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavors except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by us.

As a user of the Bot, you agree not to:
    • Trick, defraud, or mislead us and other users, especially in any attempt to learn sensitive account information such as user passwords.
    • Disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Bot.
    • Use any information obtained from the Bot in order to harass, abuse, or harm another person.
    • Make improper use of our support services or submit false reports of abuse or misconduct.
    • Use the Bot in a manner inconsistent with any applicable laws or regulations.
    • Engage in any automated use of the system, such as using scripts to send commands, or using any robots or similar tools.
    • Interfere with, disrupt, or create an undue burden on the Bot or the networks or services connected to the Bot.
    • Harass, annoy, intimidate, or threaten any of our developers engaged in providing any portion of the Bot to you.
    • Attempt to bypass any measures of the Bot designed to prevent or restrict access to the Bot, or any portion of the Bot.


## 4. CONTRIBUTION LICENSE

and your choices (including settings).


## 5. BOT MANAGEMENT

We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to: 
(1) monitor the Bot for violations of these Terms of Use;

including without limitation, reporting such user to law enforcement authorities; 
(3) in our sole discretion and without limitation, refuse, restrict access to, limit the availability of, 
or disable (to the extent technologically feasible) any of your Contributions or any portion thereof; 
(4) in our sole discretion and without limitation, notice, or liability, to remove from the Bot or otherwise disable all files and content that are 
excessive in size or are in any way burdensome to our systems; and (5) otherwise manage the Bot in a manner designed to protect our rights and 
property and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Bot.


## 6. TERM AND TERMINATION

These Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Bot. 
WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, 
DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE BOT, TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, 
WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OF USE OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE

Bot without notice at any time. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Bot.

We cannot guarantee the Bot will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or 
need to perform maintenance related to the Bot, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, 
revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Bot at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree
that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Bot 
during any downtime or discontinuance of the Bot. Nothing in these Terms of Use will be construed to obligate us to maintain and 
support the Bot or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.

You are solely responsible for all data that you transmit or that relates to any activity you have undertaken using the Bot.

arising from any such loss or corruption of such data.


## 14. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND SIGNATURES

## 15. MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Bot or in respect to the Bot constitute the entire agreement and understanding 
between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture,
partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Bot. 
You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have
